# Installations
Log into Puhti, either with ssh (Mac/Linux) or PuTTy (Windows)  

Open a screen for the installations.
```
screen -S installations
```

**FastQC & MultiQC**  
Two programs for sequence data quality control. Both will be installed using Bioconda package management tool that can be found from CSC.  
When using Bioconda at CSC, everything needs to be installed in virtual enviroments. You can create the virtual environment called `QC_env` and install the packages with one command.  
```
module load bioconda/3
conda create -n QC_env multiqc fastqc python=2.7
```

The environment can be activate with the command `source activate QC_env`. And deactivated with `source deactivate`.  
For now, just create the environment, we will need it soon.

Detach from the installations screen with `Ctrl a + d`.  

**_STOP HERE AND GO TO THE [QC & TRIMMING PART](https://github.com/karkman/MetagenomeCourse2019/blob/master/Day1/README.md#data-download)_**

Go back to the installations screen with `screen -r installations`.  

**Anvi'o**  
Create a virtual environment for Anvi'o and install all dependencies using Bioconda. (takes 5–10 min)  

Use this: http://merenlab.org/2016/06/26/installation-v2/ !!!!

This is old information. 
```
module load bioconda/3
conda create -y --name anvio-6.2 python=3.6

```

Let's test it  
```
# Activate the Anvi'o virtual environment
source activate anvio5
# Run the mini test
anvi-self-test --suite mini
```
We will also need to install NCBIs COG databases and reformat them so they can be used later. The formatting step includes changing reorganizing information in raw files, serializing a very large text file into binary Python object for fast access while converting protein IDs to COGs, and finally generating BLAST and DIAMOND search databases.

```
anvi-setup-ncbi-cogs --num-threads 4
```

**CheckM**  
For assessing the quality of recovered genomes
```
conda create -n checkm_env pplacer checkm-genome numpy python=2
```
After creating the environment you need to download database for `checkM`. Activate the environment and download the files to checkm folder in your work directory.  
Then run `checkm data setRoot` and tell `checkM` where the data is ( `/projapp/project_xxxxx/checkm_db` where xxx is your csc project number).

```
source activate checkm_env
/projapp/project_xxxxx/
mkdir checkm_db
cd checkm_db
wget https://data.ace.uq.edu.au/public/CheckM_databases/checkm_data_2015_01_16.tar.gz
tar -xzvf checkm_data_2015_01_16.tar.gz
checkm data setRoot /projapp/project_xxxxx/checkm_db/
```

**Humann2**
```
conda create -n humann2_env humann2
```

**Metaphlan plotting environment**
```
conda create -n metaphlan_plot_env -c bioconda hclust2 graphlan export2graphlan
```

~**Centrifuge**  
For taxonomic annotation of contigs in Anvi'o. Go again to the application folder and get the programs from GitHub using command `git`. Anvi'o relies on an older version ("branch") of the program, so we need to checkout the branch specified.  
You can read more about Centrifuge from the website where we clone it.
```
cd /projapp/project_xxxxx/
git clone https://github.com/infphilo/centrifuge
cd centrifuge
# We need a certain version, so checkout the branch specified
git checkout 30e3f06ec35bc83e430b49a052f551a1e3edef42
make
# Test it, should be version 1.0.2-beta  
./centrifuge --version  
```
Download the pre-computed indexes for centrifuge (Can take 20 min).  
```
cd /projapp/project_xxxxx/
# make a folder for the indices and download the indices there
mkdir centrifuge_db
cd centrifuge_db
wget ftp://ftp.ccb.jhu.edu/pub/infphilo/centrifuge/data/p+h+v.tar.gz
# After download, unpack the files and remove the tar file.
tar -zxvf p+h+v.tar.gz && rm -rf p+h+v.tar.gz
```

Set an environmental variable pointing to the centrifuge folder.
You need to change the path to _**your**_ centrifuge folder.
```
export CENTRIFUGE_BASE="/projapp/project_xxxxx/centrifuge_db"
echo $CENTRIFUGE_BASE
# Needs to be done every time after logging out
```
**Optional**  
######################################################  
OR you can add it to your `.bashrc`.  
Go to home folder and open `.bashrc` with a text editor.  
Add things after the `# User specific aliases and functions`. Make sure they pointy to the right place on your own folders.  
```
export CENTRIFUGE_BASE="/projapp/project_xxxxx/centrifuge_db"
# You can add also the centrifuge executable to your PATH
export PATH=$PATH:/projapp/project_xxxxx/centrifuge
```
If you did set the env variable before, you can remove it first and then set it thru `.bashrc`.  
```
unset CENTRIFUGE_BASE
echo $CENTRIFUGE_BASE # This should give an empty row at this point

#Then run
source .bashrc
# And test that it worked.
centrifuge --version
echo $CENTRIFUGE_BASE
```

**Metaxa2**  
For taxonomic profiling of the samples using the rimmed reads.
```
cd $USERAPPL
wget http://microbiology.se/sw/Metaxa2_2.2.tar.gz
tar -xzvf Metaxa2_2.2.tar.gz
cd Metaxa2_2.2
```
Test it, you will need to load the biokit first, because Metaxa2 uses HMMER3 and BLAST.
```
module load biokit
./metaxa2 -i test.fasta -o TEMP --plus
```
Then you can remove the results  
`rm TEMP*`  

You can also add Metaxa2 to your `$PATH` (go to --> `.bashrc`)  

**Sourmash**
```
conda create -n sourmash_env -c bioconda -c conda-forge sourmash
```
